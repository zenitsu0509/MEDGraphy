# MEDGraphy: A Graph RAG Drug Information App

MEDGraphy is an intelligent, interactive drug information application that leverages a Neo4j graph database and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with the Groq Llama3-8B model. It provides users with a powerful tool to query medical information, check for drug interactions, and visualize complex relationships within the data.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Full RAG Pipeline**: Ask general questions about medicines and get context-aware answers generated by an LLM.
- **Direct Medicine Lookup**: Quickly find the uses and side effects of a specific drug.
- **Condition-Based Search**: Discover which medicines are used to treat a particular condition.
- **Interaction Checker**: Identify potential drug interactions by finding medicines with the same active ingredients.
- **Vector Similarity Search**: Find semantically similar medicines based on their descriptions or uses.
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Explore the relationships between medicines, conditions, side effects, and active ingredients in an interactive graph.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python
- **Database**: Neo4j
- **LLM**: Groq (Llama3-8B)
- **Embeddings**: Sentence-Transformers

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A running Neo4j Aura instance (or local installation)
- A Groq API Key

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd MEDGraphy
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your credentials. For Streamlit Cloud deployment, you will use `st.secrets`.

```env
# Neo4j Credentials
NEO4J_URI="neo4j+s://your-aura-instance.databases.neo4j.io"
NEO4J_USER="neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD="your-password"

# Groq API Key
GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

### 6. Load Data into Neo4j

The data for this project is sourced from a CSV file and needs to be loaded into your Neo4j database. This process includes creating nodes, relationships, and vector embeddings.

A Google Colab notebook has been prepared to handle this entire data loading and graph creation process.

**‚û°Ô∏è [Open the Data Loading Notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wU_SoKgtj0ucv02O2KWI1IoZor-qLZgA?usp=sharing)**

Follow the instructions in the notebook to connect to your Neo4j instance and populate it with the required data.

### 7. Run the Streamlit App

Once your database is populated, you can run the application locally:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The application will open in your web browser, ready for you to explore!
